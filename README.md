Data:
The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) of a year/cohort dependent on your group num-
ber. You will use cohort 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 or 2020 ( HC-181/HC-192/HC-201/HC-209/
HC-216/HC-224 Full Year Consolidated Data File ). The data are a pseudo panel of US-households
interviewed in the speciﬁed year. Each member of the households is interviewed but if the child is too
young one of the parents does the interview. Be aware that there are actually three moments of inter-
view that sometimes gives information on the same questions and sometimes on other questions. The
